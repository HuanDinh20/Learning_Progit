"""
Occasionally, this process doesn’t go smoothly. If you changed the same part of the same file
differently in the two branches you’re merging, Git won’t be able to merge them cleanly. If your fix
for issue #53 modified the same part of a file as the hotfix branch, you’ll get a merge conflict.
take example like:

apple
red
green
blue
John
James

- now create 2 branches name: dev1, dev2
