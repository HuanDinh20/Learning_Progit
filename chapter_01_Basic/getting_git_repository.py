"""
You typically obtain a Git repository in one of two ways:
1. You can take a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git
repository
2. You can clone an existing Git repository from elsewhere.
***** Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory *****
cd to/your/directories
and then
git init

This creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your necessary repository files â€” a
Git repository skeleton.
If you want to start version-controlling existing files (as opposed to an empty directory), you should
probably begin tracking those files and do an initial commit
